# Cool-Reference-Website-Designs
A collection of websites I come across that really get me going.


A simple blog layout which provides ample space for the actual blog, a right gutter for advertisements or other articles etc and a nice little left side gutter. The top navbar is minimal but contains a lot of resources within easy reach. The animations are minimal but stylish. The footer is very content rich and takes up a lot of screen real estate to allow the viewer to focus solely on it. A downside is that the advertisement right gutter seems to have a set number of elements (Quite a lot) which if the actual article isn't very long, leaves a lot of blank space before the bottom of the page, so the footer is potentially missed and a lot of the advertisement content is missed too.
